    "This program simulates the creation of a synthetic dataset related to patient data for medications and conditions. It then splits this dataset into \n",
    "training and testing sets to train a machine learning model and evaluate its accuracy.\n",

    "Let's break down the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Generation: Synthetic patient data is created, including features such as age, medication, condition, and outcome. This mimics a scenario where \n",
    "patient information regarding age, prescribed medications, existing conditions, and the outcome of a treatment is collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation: The categorical variables ('Medication' and 'Condition') are encoded using one-hot encoding to convert them into numerical format \n",
    "suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train-Test Split: The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection. This step ensures that \n",
    "the model can learn from a portion of the data and be tested on another unseen portion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Training: A RandomForestClassifier is trained on the training data (X_train and y_train). This classifier learns patterns from the provided \n",
    "features (age, medication, and condition) to predict the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction and Evaluation: The trained model (clf) makes predictions on the test set (X_test), and the accuracy of these predictions is calculated \n",
    "using accuracy_score. The accuracy score indicates the proportion of correctly predicted outcomes from the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this program is a basic demonstration of a machine learning workflow for a binary classification task using a RandomForestClassifier on a \n",
    "synthetic dataset representing patient data related to medications and conditions. The print statement displays the accuracy achieved by the model on \n",
    "the test data.\n",
